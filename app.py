         This is a project I implemented with my classmate Halil Ibrahim at Wild Code 
         School, where i learnt to become a data analyst. Our target is to create the 
         MRF - Movie Recommendation System which will recommend similar titles to user's 
         given title according to Genres, popularity, Duration, etc. 
                  
         We started with 10.73 millions titles that we explored to understand the content
         of all the given datasets. We filtered to down-size into a dataset of 450k titles.
         We then clean and remove missing values to get a final one with 430k titles.

         About the creation of the recommendation system, we first convert all the text 
         values into numeric values by using LabelEncoder for column 'Type' and method 
         which converted each category of column 'Genres' into a label with binary values.

         Since this is a non-supervised model, we passed the step 'model traing' by going 
         directly to the prediction of NearestNeighbors, an unsupervised learner for 
         implementing neighbor searches.

         We then tried to change the hyperparameter to get our model better but we dont' see
         much improvement so we sorted values by setting the weight on Votes and Genres.
